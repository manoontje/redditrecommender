In this sense you defend an action taken in response to their thinking, just not the kind of action. The kind of thinking that leads to genocide is not rational, its not sensible, and its not fair. There is no just motive that makes people believe in mass rape. That is hate. Your entire premise is that there's a just way to think of another people in a way that can make you want to do this.\n\n&gt;which is that you think I'm excusing rape\n\nOn some level you are to an extent. Its like if someone said \"so and so got raped by her ex\" and someone replied \"well she did screw him over hard in the divorce\". You know saying that is fucked up and you know the impulse to consider the action that way and then express it says something terrible about how the speaker is envisioning the dynamics of the relationship.\n\nWhen people are tried for crimes the things you're saying are used as mitigation. The reasoning behind an act is used to lessen or strengthen the condemnation and ensuing punishment for the act. On any level where you look at how our value system manifests judgment for actions taken you are mitigating it.\n\n&gt;The problem with your argument is that nowhere did I say I supported the how of the Burmese actions\n\nI already acknowledged that.

{"author":"BrungardtBlade-Tool","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"body":"As for the name? I doubt he was the first to pioneer it but I've always called them Wheeler handles or Wheeler knock off's because he does it correctly while the majority fall short.\n\nI love the look of these handles in photo's but the pinky swell is almost always too wide/fat for my tastes. Not a fan of having my index grip tighter than my pinky's. I prefer an equal grip across the handle or slight tapering towards the rear.\n\nI understand the idea behind the design but it is actually counter intuitive for such a small knife. The flair is better suited on a chopper above 10\" in blade length. Think Kukri handles.\n\nIf my pinky doesn't touch or nearly touch the inside of my palm when I grip it, it's too fat and diminish the overall grip. I'm not a big guy but I have piano fingers and if the blade wont fit my hand it wont fit a 6' 5\" mans hand correctly either with there extra body fat.\n\nIf you want a great example of these in slight variations look too Nick Wheeler. He does it right. You'll notice the pinky swell on most of his models are obviously smaller than the index grip unlike the one in the linked photo. And if they are not they are more dramatically shaped at the rear. Doesn't look as pretty but I feel it's more practical.\n\nHere's a great [example](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXwy6dKFuew/?taken-by=nick_wheeler_knives_and_newfs). It may be hard to tell for some but that extra meat being removed will make a world of difference in the hand.\n\nQuick test for people at home. Hold your hand up.

{"author":"AlanYx","author_flair_css_class":"","author_flair_text":"iPad Pro 10.5\" 4G","body":"I'm super picky about screens, and I don't think it really matters. There is an office supply store near me that still has 9.7 inch iPad Pros on display as well as the new iPad 2017, and I'm not kidding, I thought they mislabeled the demo units. I was so convinced they had swapped the labels on the demo units that I had to put the serial numbers in a search engine to verify that the iPad 2017 and the iPad Pro 9.7 were properly labeled.\n\nIf you know what to look for, it's more clear, but it is hard to tell the units apart if you're doing it for the first time.\n\nIncidentally, the screen on the iPad 2017 is not \"bad\". In fact, if you Google the Notebookcheck measurements of the screen, it's actually quite accurate. (In terms of measured DeltaE within the sRGB gamut, both grey and color, it's actually better than the measurements Notebookcheck got for the 10.5 iPad Pro -- though individual numbers aren't everything and there will obviously be variation between panels.)\n\nTwo good things about the iPad 2017 that I've noticed: \n\n* There is less color variation severely off-angle than both generations of the iPad Pros. I think this is due to the difference in coatings, or perhaps the presence of the sensing layer for the Apple Pencil.\n\n* The anti-fingerprint oleophobic coating on the iPad 2017 is definitely more effective than on the Pros. I think they had to compromise there to support the Apple Pencil.\n\nThere is a little more brightness variation on the iPad 2017 in comparison to the Pros, and of course there is no support for an extended gamut or 120 Hz. But on the positive side, I find the iPad 2017 is easier to hold in the hand because of the bezel size and the slightly smaller screen is better for reading eBooks.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to buy the iPad 2017. I think it's one of the best deals Apple has ever offered.","can_gild":true,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1506816015,"distinguished":null,"edited":1506816205,"gilded":0,"id":"dnqikes","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_73ffs0","parent_id":"t3_73ffs0","permalink":"/r/ipad/comments/73ffs0/how_important_is_the_non_laminated_display_on_tge/dnqikes/","retrieved_on":1509189612,"score":3,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ipad","subreddit_id":"t5_2rgny"},

{"author":"CummyBot2000","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":"Reposts copypasta for mobile users","body":"I, too, was at Ribfest. A rib cooker singles out some young guy wearing a white \"Where's the beef?\" T-shirt, standing off to the side. He says \"Hey buddy! That T-shirt ain't going to stay white for long\" as he points to his immaculately clean white apron, confusing those watching the exchange. The young guy says \"oh, I won't be *eating* any ribs\", and honestly his emphasis of the word *eating* creeped me out a bit, but whatever. So the cook huddles with associates and seem to come to some type of agreement and calls back over to the young guy \"Hey Buddy! Come here a minute!\" So he walks over and the cook turns on a loud white noise machine and we can't hear what they're saying. After a lot of emphatic hand waving, head nodding &amp; shaking, and some frantic scribbling and erasing on a white board, the young man walks over to the rib line (which is pretty long at this point since no one's been serving ribs). Everyone in line does a triple-take as the man takes his place in line, and the whole line is now murmuring to each other trying to make sense of it all. Someone finally incredulously asks \"What could the cook *possibly* have said to you to convince you to eat after you already declined one single time?!?\" The man smiles and says \"Well you see, I'm a VEGAN and can't eat meat, so the cook had offered to clean off the grill and make me some scrambled eggs instead.\" And one of the people in line says \"I didn't know they had scrambled eggs! I want that\". Others joined in \"Me too!\" \"I'll pay double!\" \"Triple!\" \"Money is no object!\" It was pandemonium. Another man stands in line with very puzzled look on his face. The line continues to swell as more people hear the rumor of scramble eggs and eventually all the Vegans at Ribfest make their way to the line. Finally, the puzzled man speaks up, \"Excuse me, I know this is none of my business, but do you mean vegetarian?\" The original white shirt guy gives his own puzzled look in return. So the puzzled man clarifies \"Well it's just that you said you're a vegan but you're about to eat eggs, which are an animal product - plus I think there's probably milk in it too if they're doing it right\" Someone else shouts \"And vanilla extract!\" And the puzzled guy says \"Yeah, maybe. But that's not an animal product. Anyways, I think maybe you meant vegetarian rather than vegan, since it sounds like you don't eat meat rather than all animal products?\" White shirt: \"Vegan, vegetarian, what's the difference?\" Puzzled guy: \"Um, well, I *just* explained the difference. You know what? Never mind; it's none of my business anyway.\" Then someone pipes up \"Won't the egg mixture just run through the grill?\" \"Maybe they have a skillet?\" someone replied. \n\nAfter all the eggs were handed out everyone held hands and ate their eggs (with their faces pressed into the paper plates since they didn't have their hands free). It was the most beautiful thing I've ever witnessed; people of all genders coming together and eating scramble eggs with their faces. I shed a single tear and clapped, a slow non-sarcastic clap. My hands were free because I couldn't eat the eggs - I'm gluten intolerant. u/manic_eye","can_gild":true,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1506816015,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"id":"dnqikf7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_73ig5q","parent_id":"t3_73ig5q","permalink":"/r/copypasta/comments/73ig5q/ribfest/dnqikf7/","retrieved_on":1509189614,"score":1,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"copypasta","subreddit_id":"t5_2r6z7"},

She's in a one year old room (she's 19 months) at the center that I work at.  Group size is small (3 teachers for a class of 6) and I love the her teachers. She's  helper at school but gets whiny if she's hungry and it's not snack time or lunch time yet.  So pretty reasonable! Everyone loves her.  Except for that one time that she covered herself in bird poop on the playground somehow.  I thought it was hilarious.\n\nThe worst part is having to pre-make food for her every single day.  Breakfast, AM Snack, Lunch, and PM Snack. So tiring! Luckily we're getting a routine down for that too.\n\nNot School related- My husband bought me a piece of wood so that I can make a height ruler chart to have on the wall in our apartment.  I want to make it (as opposed to just using a door jamb) so that when we get a house of our own we can bring it with us!  I'm excited :)\n\nTLDR: First month at school is great!

M113s, Grizzly, Cougar and Husky armored vehicles, multiple artillery batteries, Air Force helicopters for infantry air assaults, air defense batteries, thousands of mortar rounds, the fucking FN, New MLVW's, Rambo tier amounts of M72's, parade squares that fit 1500 soldiers and full support battalions were normal things. Sometimes Reg force was fully/partially involved, sometimes they weren't.\n\nCompared to now. \nMaybe 300 or 400 reservists will go one exercise if the Land Force Area can afford it that year. No M113's, no LAV's, Shit ass LSVW/Milverado/G-Wagon/MLVW vehicles. No artillery except the 4 forty year old field guns that the artillery platoons have in the whole province. Maybe the Air Force will be able to afford to send out 1 or 2 unarmed helicopters for a day or two. Maybe the medics will set up a tent if they can get enough members to go on exercise. The food will come from the base kitchen or will be MRE's because the service battalions are incapable of getting enough people or equipment to provide those services. Any M72 training will be 35mm training insert on a reused tube. Your unit and the exerciser run out of training rounds so you literally say \"Bang Bang\" when \"shooting\". Soldiers get encouraged to stay home on range qualification days because their units can't afford to qualify everyone on even the C7 let alone the machine guns.\n\nThat same parade square has crumbled so much that it could only parade two under strength platoons. The military can't afford to fix it, and there is no point in fixing it really. The reserves totally depend on the Regular force as well.\n\n\nThat and the older aged higher ranking NCO's that are just riding it out to top up their pension.\n\n\nReservists are part time. If you are going to attract high quality and talented people to the reserves, it has to be fun. Why would anyone earn very little money one night a week and do basically nothing with not much opportunity stay? The $1.25 beers in the mess only make up for doing your 3rd BFT of the month for so long.

Right now the incentive is not to get a patent and get back to inventing because it is more profitable to get a patent and use it as a bludgeon to sue for damages and prevent others from innovating.

Since there are a lot of people talking about my window size, instead of replying individually to everyone I'll just say it here - it's just personal preference. I don't really enjoy playing with a big screen, and I feel that I don't perform as well when doing so. I kinda like being able to see my surroundings without really having to move my eyes too much (or at all), and am very used to the SQM size of this particular size. I also enjoy having a bigger chat, but that's just a nice bonus, I mainly do it for the screen's size. Too used to it by now, I guess! \n\nI apologize if it made the video uncomfortable to watch for some of you. Fullscreen should make it much better, but if you're on a phone, it really would suck, so, sorry bout that! \n\nI usually do my videos [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dcf5x3wpV3Q), the only reason I've been uploading my hunting videos with the entire screen is so you guys can see the Hunt Analyzer, Preys, stuff like that.

I just got done reading through this thread and a 3.9 GPA is extremely strong for a community college. Most CC's(Community College's) will have you take a placement tests and that will determine which class levels to take. In an ideal world you would have a good chunk of change saved up for life after the corps and use that to pay for CC Courses and you would crash at your parents place. Once your done with your Core Classes and begin your transfer to a University and start using your GI bill. If you apply for FAFSA you can also opt to do a work study which gives you a chance to work &lt;20 hours per week at the University as a side job. Being a MCWIS you should be able to land a life guard job no problem. \n\n\nPaying for Community College with the GI Bill can seem like a waste if you can pay for it out of pocket.

{"author":"xSQUALLx","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"body":"So yeah. Late last year I was travelling through Japan with some friends of mine (I tend to goto Japan for a few weeks every year) \n\nOn this occasion I met this lovely 38 year old woman named Hiroko at a cocktail bar in Kyoto. I noticed her looking my way a few times but I couldn't tell if it was good or bad because, well I'm a bigger guy and in Japan it's already a big disadvantage lol \n\nWith the power of a little liquid courage I managed to walk past her as I went to the to the bar and as I walked back I managed to make a little joke about the drink she had (wish I did in English, that could've been a waste of time lol) thankfully she saw the humor to it and asked where I am from \n\nSo we sat and spoke for a bit, found out she actually visited my city with her now ex husband a few years ago. So we already had some common ground. In the middle of chatting causally we were making cheeky jabs at each other too so I could tell there was something there. Her girlfriends arrived and so we exchanged Line IDs and went our seperate ways.\n\nNow I didnt think this would go anywhere, because I was going to Osaka the next day. But we spoke for a couple days on Line before she asked me straight up if I wanted to spend some time with her on the weekend. Of course I jumped at the opportunity and booked us an Airbnb.\n\nShe caught the train in from Kyoto and she was wearing this cute little outfit that and a little bow tie lol but she made it look cute. We headed back the Airbnb where wow it had an incredible view of Osaka Castle. \n\nWe sat down on the couch to rest our feet and she didnt waste much time. She told me she was excited because she had never been with a \"western man\" before (whether thats true or not, i dont give a shit) and went straight to unzipping my pants and reaching into grab my cock. With a smile on her face she looked and me and said \"very big\" (now for record, she's clear fan servicing. Im not overly big in that area at all. Probably just abit over average in length, pretty girthy though)\n\nShe told me stand up and when i did she ripped my pants down and got to her knees infront of me and started service my cock. Her gorgeous dark eyes staring up at me while she tried her best to deep throat my cock was mind blowing. Not only this, she was very attentive to my sensitive spots and would torture me with them and giggle at the sight of me shaking. \n\nAfter I came I was hard again a few minutes later and ready to feel her little Japanese pussy. She layed out on the bed and I got the tip of my cock slightly in before she pushed me back and told me no! No..no? I couldnt understand, she then smirked and stood up and whispered in my earth \"you must wait\" she got dressed and told me to get my clothes on too because she wanted to have dinner.\n\nI stood there with my throbbing cock, confused and aroused haha this woman was teasing the fuck out of me and I loved it. So we went back out for a couple of hours and had dinner before heading back to the airbnb. The whole time all I could think about we fucking her brains out, I think this is exactly what she wanted.\n\nWe finally get back. She has a shower straight away and tells me to have one after her. After mine, i come out and see her on the bed wearing thigh highs and nothing else. They were pinching in her skin ever so much that it caused a slight dimple in the skin, so hot!\n\nShe sits down on the bed and gestures me over and stops me when im leaning down to kiss her. She puts her hand on my head and pushes me down so i am level with her pussy and demands me to eat it and you bet I did. Her pussy tasted incredible and I could tell from sliding a finger into her pussy that it was gonna be tough when my cock was going to enter.\n\nAfter willingly complying to her demands and eating her pussy she told me that i had waited long enough and now i was allowed to enter her. We started with her on her back and her holding her legs back. It took abit of work and some lube, but that moment of penetration where her eyes shut tight, mouth gasped, head back and hands gripped the blanket beneath her is an image and feeling i'll never forget.\n\nI had to work her tight pussy slowly to begin with though and as she became more used to my girth she started to push against me and as my cock pushed a little further in each time she would let out a sigh. When we finally worked it in and we could build up a good rhythm it was amazing. This gorgeous Japanese woman taking my cock and shaking and one put she was moaning so hard i could see a vessel form on her forehead before she finally gasped for air and let go of the blankets.\n\nAfter seeing her let go i decided to lean down and scoop her up. Her legs dangling over my arms and i held onto her cute little ass. She put her arms around my neck and held on while I pounded fuck out of her pussy but she could only handle this for a couple of minutes because it was beginning to hurt.\n\nSo I placed her back onto the bed on all fours and teased her pussy and clit from behind with my cock before slowling re-entering her incredible pussy. With her thrust in she would push back. Her ass was the tight little thing but enough meat for me to grab a handful with each hand and pound away her. \n\nThere was a moment I looked up and realised how cool everything was about this too as i looked out the window and saw osaka castle lit up and i stopped for a moment, still inside her and told her to look too. She shared the same enthusiasm of how cool this experience was. We went back to push each others sexual limits and fucking like animals for the rest of night.\n\nWe lazed around in bed together the next morning before we had a couple more rounds of sex and then check out. We got brunch. Went to some cool bamboo forest and shrines. We said our goodbyes and that was that. We still keep in touch but we are both busy. Hopefully when I'm in Japan next we'll be able to hook up again :)","can_gild":true,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1506816050,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"id":"dnqil9c","is_submitter":true,"link_id":"t3_73igc4","parent_id":"t3_73igc4","permalink":"/r/AsiansGoneWild/comments/73igc4/my_time_with_a_mature_japanese_lady_story_in/dnqil9c/","retrieved_on":1509189626,"score":9,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AsiansGoneWild","subreddit_id":"t5_2wm0g"},

{"author":"valuedota","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"body":"2) Mechanics is basically reaction time similar to gun skill.  All that you listed is relevant with one additional important note.  In Dota you acquire two resources: gold and experience.  You get these resources in three ways, killing creeps, killing enemy heroes, and killing towers.  In the early game killing creeps is the most important way to get these resources. The mid lane is as close at it gets to a fair fight (its a neutral lane not closer to either teams base and historically was played as a 1v1 contest) so there is a lot of contesting over last hits (also known as CS).  So people that find success in the mid lane tend to have really good reactions to win these 1v1s.  Also a lot of mid heroes are \"flashy\" with fast movement based abilities.  So you usually want your most mechanically talented player located there.\n\n3) The offlaner is probably the most vulnerable (its sometimes called the hard lane) since you are usually playing 1 vs 2 or 3 heroes.  But mid and the mid tower are often a very important early advantage and the focus of a lot of action early on in the game.  Since you can teleport to towers and they give vision the mid tower (with its neutral central location) is a very important objective to open up space on the opponents side of the map.\n\nRecently the \"new meta\" has been the position 4 player sitting mid, turning mid into a duel lane vs its historical 1v1.  The nice thing about Dota is that there aren't really fixed positions for how you set up your lanes.  Every team will send 1 hero to each lane, but what you do with your two supports depends on draft and strategy.  You can go aggro and send them all to the offlane, you can have 1 in the safe lane and 1 roam, etc.  \n\n4) Depends on the team, a lot of times coaches in Dota are picked up right before a LAN since they are often pro players that didn't qualify for the LAN.  For instance Pajkatt was the coach of DC during their TI6 2nd place run (Misery's team) since his team wasn't able to qualify.","can_gild":true,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1506816061,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"id":"dnqilik","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_73hm7y","parent_id":"t1_dnqhpk8","permalink":"/r/OpTicGaming/comments/73hm7y/dota_your_new_dota_boys_and_the_roles_they_play/dnqilik/","retrieved_on":1509189631,"score":5,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"OpTicGaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2xpuo"},

I finally stabilized at the same weight as my last visit at my 20 week appointment. I think I followed the same trend last time, but I still only gained a net 7 pounds when my 7 pound baby was delivered. But she was 7 pounds 5 ounces at 38 weeks and perfectly healthy. She always measured on track, and my doctor never said anything negative. I also went on to gain all the baby weight from stress and comfort eating postpartum. :/ Really, if your baby is growing well and your doctor isn't worried, especially if you have fat stored up, weight gain isn't strictly necessary. You and baby both will be fueled off your stored fat (which is the purpose of it). You just really want to make sure you're getting enough calcium (baby will leach it straight out of your bones if you're not getting enough from your diet). And keep up on your prenatal vitamin.\n\nSo my appetite is pretty small. I just can't eat much at a sitting and loading up at meals isn't an option for me. Figure out healthy, reasonably energy dense foods you can snack on through the day like nuts and cheese, fruits and veggies. I like to nibble on beef jerky sometimes or peanut butter. I also started drinking milk sometimes, mostly because I think it's tasty but I only seem to when I'm pregnant.","can_gild":true,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1506816065,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"id":"dnqillx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_73fayd","parent_id":"t3_73fayd","permalink":"/r/BabyBumps/comments/73fayd/natural_weight_gain/dnqillx/","retrieved_on":1509189633,"score":1,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BabyBumps","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7cl"},

Compared to RobinF who with a few merges can counter +10 opposition running double goads and hone.\n\nIndigo requires bowbreaker (or lots of spurs) to kill a BLyn that runs Mulagir. Ignoring defensive battles, at neutral atk, a simple +6 atk from any source (Ex. Hone/Ally Support) is enough for Indigo to kill a BLyn running Brave Bow, this of course changes dramatically if they run fortify as well. \n\nThe simplest way for Indigo to deal with Blyn is bow breaker, which comes at an expense for some in the form of WoM or GTB.\n\nMeta Reinhardt's running QP/DB/DB3/Moonbow with 1 hone and goad can still kill a unmerged RES Indigo not running buffs, requiring +3~5 res to handle hone x1goad/x2 goads, which can be simply Fort Res1 Seal+Ally Support+HP/Res Seal on Indigo.\n\ntl;dr unmerged Indigo will help against unmerged opposition like a prince charming.

Can this behaviour be changed so that they all start collapsed and only expand/collapse when clicked?\n\nWould it be reasonable to put an accordion table inside another? Cause it seems to me like I'd have to to achieve two levels as intended. While we're at it, would it be possible to dynamically add panels to both levels based on the imported data (mentioned in point 3 in the OP)?\n\nLastly; how flexible are accordion tables when it comes to styling?

Alas, we are left with no resolution on this, just like we are left with no resolution on Audrey whatsoever.\n\nI think your instincts are good, but that you are being too specific and literal with these scenes. Someone already posted the Lynch quote saying that the Roadhouse vignettes were never meant to be anything other than \"slice-of-life\" moments in the town of Twin Peaks, with no connection to the larger story. What I do think they connect to are the themes of awakening and duality. The show gives us many clues that we are watching two worlds, and that awakening is the key to crossing from one to the other.\n\nIn my opinion, the Roadhouse is a junction point between worlds. Anyone seen in the Roadhouse is not awakened in the beginning of TP, and awakens by the end.\n\n* Audrey is the most obvious\n* James was in an accident and is \"quiet\" now\n* Shelly is trapped in the same self-destructive cycle of being with terrible men\n\nThe random bar conversations are part of this same routine. Whether it's drugs or insanity or infidelity, the people are all trapped in some kind of cage. When they awaken, they will be gone from the Roadhouse forever, just like Audrey.\n\nRichard was probably trapped by his own evil heart, hence his appearance at the Roadhouse.

The company is called BitPetite and the concept is great! Below are few details of what they have going on and I also received a newsletter from them that they will be expanding their investment options so, I think this site is not a scam but like all HYIP's, withdraw your monies on a daily basis. So far, I have earned over $100 and have only been in it for 2 weeks. I usually test the waters first before I invest a bit more and with that said, I will be investing into LiteCoin. 2 investment options: 147% after 6 weeks and 180% after 9 weeks. Interest: 3.97% on working days and 1.00% on weekends. Minimum deposit: 0.005 BTC. Refund of the principal along with interest payments. Withdrawal minimum: 0.005 BTC or $10. Payment methods: Bitcoin or USD equivalent. Affiliate program: 10%-5%-2%. Here's the link to join this opportunity and like I always say, I am not a financial adviser thus, you are investing into these things at your own risk. But as for me, what is life without taking some small risk? Invest small and see what you think but I honestly can tell you it's worked for me thus far.

{"author":"sonder_lust","author_flair_css_class":"","author_flair_text":"I become the blob.","body":"Fair enough.\n\nI see a bit more actual substance to some of his claims than you do, clearly.\n\nI agree with you, the hate crime law doesn't seem to me like a slippery slope to anything. I do agree with his proposition that you cannot codify into law preferred pronoun usage. I would never intentionally misgender someone, and I would do my best to use whatever pronoun a person prefers, but I do not want to live in a society where it's a crime if I get that wrong. I think there is reasonable room for discussion about where compassion and function meet on something like that.\n\nI don't agree with his stance on the nuclear family and by association his criticism of other models of being. I think the nuclear family is a model that works for many people, but I know in point of fact that it does not work for many others. I think people should be free to do what they see fit. I know of no evidence that suggests gay adoption is in any way inferior to straight adoption. I wasn't aware he had made statements to that affect, but it doesn't totally surprise me that he did.\n\nI agree that we should encourage people to embrace their gender and sexuality as fluid. More freedom and more ability to be true to one's reality is good. \n\nBut I agree with him that there is an anti-science and anti-discourse bent to some of the present political climate on the left. I'm squarely in the left on the American political spectrum, but I sense more and more that there is a tendency to dismiss anything, whether an idea, a study, or a person, that conflicts with progressive views as so self-evidently wrong, ignorant, and hateful as to not even deserve consideration. I sense that even in myself sometimes, and I don't like it. Some things are self-evidently wrong, ignorant, and hateful. But the vast majority of things about which people disagree are not that way. I don't see a lot of people on either side who seem interested in increasing the level of nuance to their opinions. I also feel that there is a chilling effect in much of public discourse. I don't even like the guy, but by merely talking about him and not just bashing him, I feel like I'm likely to get downvotes. I don't care about internet points, but I do think there's pressure to agree or be silent. That would just be one exceedingly silly example. The left does it to the right. The right does it to the left. That's probably always been so. But I feel increasingly the far left does it to people who basically share their goals.\n\nI studied a fair bit of postmodern philosophy in school, which I admit was several years ago now. I kind of agree with his characterization of its issues and flaws (basically that its claims are true only in the abstract and claims that cannot be functionally applied should be treated as false, even if not logically falsifiable- like, for instance, solipsism). I do not share his opinion that the whole thing has an underlying ulterior motive of destroying Western civilization. I would be interested specifically in your take on where he strays regarding postmodern philosophy, because it's been a while for me.\n\nI think certain academic disciplines are rather corrupt. I'm open to discussion about a lot of things, but it's wild to me that a Yale professor more or less got run out of town for questioning whether cultural appropriation is for real. Cultural appropriation, microaggressions, patriarchy, white privilege, rape culture... I think there's real, honest to God truth in this stuff, but when I really think about the world I live in, I have trouble swallowing some of it whole hog without adding at least a pinch of nuance. And if a professor at an institution can lose their job for trying to do so, how can anyone else? Shouldn't we want to know the truth about those things? Doesn't that require critical reflection?\n\nAnd, for the Christianity piece, I think he makes an excellent observation (or takes one, anyway, from Dostoevsky and Neitzsche). The erosion of that as a unifying force has increased the chaos in societies. But I don't share his pessimism or resentment about it. Our society is more plural. I think the Christian tradition gave societies a toolkit. I believe that any tools from that kit that still have value will be retained, and to hell with the rest. But I don't disagree with his notion (and this was more or less Neitzsche's take) that you can toss out bad tools from Christianity, and perhaps we must, but that doesn't mean you immediately have replacements that work better. I believe we'll find them, but I do think the twentieth century had it's share of nihilism, and I do think that even today people struggle to find purpose and it can harm them. I don't mourn Christianity, and I assume we'll figure that out, but it's fair to say that, absent an externally imposed value system, people struggle to create an internal one. That's a real phenomenon in my opinion.\n\n\n\n\n","can_gild":true,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1506816084,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"id":"dnqim2p","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_73fqfd","parent_id":"t1_dnqh64g","permalink":"/r/SubredditDrama/comments/73fqfd/is_saying_someone_has_a_few_good_points_apologism/dnqim2p/","retrieved_on":1509189640,"score":1,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SubredditDrama","subreddit_id":"t5_2ss5b"},

When I got my first short story published in an anthology you could go to the store and buy, I cried. It was the end result of a long and hard road. I've recently finished my second full-length novel (the first one I'm trying to sell) and it's been two months of mostly rejections. But that's the game. You have to find that right agent. And then they have to find that right publisher, and so on, and three years from now I might be able to walk into a store and buy my book.

He was still the same kind and thoughtful guy I knew from my childhood. He'd had more than his fair share of misfortune. Some of it was his fault and some wasn't but he owned every bit of it. He never blamed anyone but himself. When I asked him how he manages it all he said, \"It's my life. What else can I do?\"\n\nAfterwards we said our goodbyes and went our separate ways, back to our families and our lives. I was so happy to have reconnected with him and I thought we'd continue to be a part of each other's lives for many years to come.  A month later, he died unexpectedly and all alone of a heart attack. Oh how I wish I could have spent more time with him. I just didn't know there wasn't any time left.","can_gild":true,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1506816097,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"id":"dnqime5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_73i3ls","parent_id":"t3_73i3ls","permalink":"/r/AskReddit/comments/73i3ls/if_you_had_the_chance_to_repeat_a_day_in_your/dnqime5/","retrieved_on":1509189644,"score":1,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskReddit","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i"},

He did care. He cried his eyes out and begged me to stay, asked me over and over to please stay and give him one more chance. Even clung to me and kept saying please please please, I'll do everything different! It was the hardest thing I had to do in my life, walking away and purposely hurting someone to save my own happiness. It was the hardest but also the best decision I have ever made. It has been years since then and I'm sure he had a hard time at first. There was just nothing I could do for him, every conversation we had just gave him hope we would be okay again. I'm glad he could rely on his parents for support. I felt so guilty at first, especially because I started dating someone new a lot earlier than him.

I'm also buying some duct tape, rope, some food and water. And a few of those foil emergency blankets. I'm going to make a bunch of small fires all over the place, and use them to heat the ceramic pots. These are to serve as false heat signatures all over the place.  \nMeanwhile, I'll be in an alley across the street, behind a fence, covered in the foil blankets to conceal body heat. The tank will probably use the road to get to my address because my cul-de-sac is relatively inaccessible without driving through other houses. That puts me right behind it, at which point I run and climb right on top of the turret. That'll take like 5 seconds, so hopefully I'm not spotted.  Once on top I lie spread eagled, and securely rope/tape myself to whatever stanchions and protuberances there are on top, in order to avoid exhausting myself or falling off. Then wait for 24 hours to win!

{"author":"stevenvanroosmalen","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"body":"Dear Pandarth_Omega,\n\nLuckily for you - or maybe not so much - I read your entire reply. In this comment I will be clearing some things up, setting the records straight, while replying to some of your remarks directly. Therefore I will quote your previous post in order to achieve full transparency. I feel we need this in both of our lives right now. Correct me if I'm being to presumptuous. \n\n**Honest**\n&gt;I thank you for your honest reply\n\nI must confess. I wasn't honest at all, for I have never read the 4th issue of The Thanos Imperative. So I merely guessed that Thanos said \"No\" in this issue. My conclusion - as you have correctly pointed out - is flawed and playfull mockery. \n\n**Fun**\n&gt;As it seems you have not quite understood the latter point, let me put it to you as plainly as I can. This post was made for fun.\n\nWhile I was teasing you with my clearly false theory - on which I will elaborate later - it wasn't my intention to give you the impression that I took your theory fully serious or that I didn't enjoy myself. Although this section isn't titled **honest**, I still believe I am when I state that my opening sentence was fully sincere. I shall quote myself here - one thing I always enjoy doing - to show you to what sentence I'm referring: \"I intensely enjoyed reading your - how shall I call it? - Theory.\" Your writing style, wit and the theory itself are entertaining. I was merely inspired by your post to reply with another theory. And since I do not believe in the meaning you get from those numbers (D23), I decided to exaggerate in an even more far-fetched theory. \n\n**I told you so**\n&gt;your telling me \"I told you so\" has no meaning\n\nIn my modest opinion. I told you so always has meaning. If nothing else, it may hint at a character flaw of the one posing this statement. \n\n**My clearly false theory**\n&gt;I can only imagine how long it took you to accomplish this.\n\nIt took me 10 minutes. I think. \n\n&gt; Your theory was built on three numbers which were never shown in the film; to discover them one would have to pay very close attention to the film and, likely as not, watch it multiple times. \n\nI googled \"Captain America Winter Soldier Numbers\" in order to get some data quickly. I quickly found this picture: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a9/8f/9b/a98f9bce6365417da8056ae3339d8e7c.jpg\nI choose three numbers - which only had in common that Captain America himself was involved - and tried googling some dates. Luckily I found that The Thanos Imperative was released on one of the possible dates. As you can see, this is no achievement at all. Of course, while having fun, I was also trying to point out that giving meaning to numbers isn't that difficult. And while I will admit, the numbers in your theory have a clearer connection to each other, I still think it isn't a meaningful one. I cannot disprove this - and since you're not that serious about it, I probably won't have to - but I simply highly, highly doubt a director or marketing team would put in coded messages about trailer drops for a movie that far ahead of time. It is way more likely that this is just coincidence (if the trailer does drop at October 14th). \n\n**The Trailer**\n&gt;As I mentioned in my original post, a quick look through recent activity will reveal that the most popular answer is \"sometime in October\"\n\nThis is likely. I think the trailer will drop around Thor: Ragnarok. This strategy will remind moviegoers that the Thor film might be worth checking out because he's in Infinity War. And we all want to know which events will lead-up to that movie. But this is merely a prediction of Marvels overall strategy. You probably wouldn't be surprised at this point that I too think the Infinity War trailer will be dropped at the end of October or the beginning of November. \"Around October\" sounds accurate to me. \n\nu/AdmiralSnackBar69's analysis is therefore much more reliable then your fun-to-read-theory. He doesn't look at a coded message - which we just entertainingly assume it might be a coded message - but he looks at production trends. \n\n**Closing**\n\nIt was never my intend to be hurtful or mock you as an author. I really enjoyed reading your text. So maybe I didn't formulate my reply as carefully as I could have. English isn't my first language, so communicating can be difficult sometimes. That being said, I don't feel you took it the wrong way. Your reply was equally entertaining. This exchange of simple words we've had today was so fun and inspiring, that I think we should become electronic pen pals. \n\nTo summarize: \n\n- I had fun reading your original post and your reply. \n\n- I was fully aware you were not entirely serious. \n\n- My theory was very much incorrect. \n\n- I think a trailer will drop in October/November.\n\n- While I was mocking, I hope you know by now it wasn't meant to be hurtful, personal or hateful. \n\n\nHopefully, I cleared some things up. If not, if everything I said you already knew or assumed, then consider my post simply as meaningless rambling, attention seeking or a waste of your valuable time.

That being said, he'll play fcm and battlecon with me all day, ironically.\n\nAnother friend has kids 10, 8, 6, who all like game, but they won't play **escape curse of the temple** again because the last game ended in tears, shouting, and rage. The mom and 10 year old did fine, but the 8&amp;6 struggled, and I split the group up poorly. So idiotic, I should have been with the 8&amp;6, not with the 10.\n\nI almost won't play **splendor** anymore because it removes all socialization and leads to some outburst when someone grabs the card someone else wanted.\n\nOne guy won't play **acquire** because he ran out of money real fast, couldn't buy stocks for like 6 turns, didn't have the tiles to force a merger, and walked away feeling like it was a luck fest that punished you too hard for being careless with your money. Dunno, me neither..?\n\nOne won't play **Chinatown** because the endgame is too mathy and predictable (easy to solve).\n\nAnd another won't play **dominion** anymore because it's too themeless and too pure, ie he prefers Clank, where deck building is a means to an end, not an end. By the way, he's never played a dominion expansion.\n\nI won't play any of the **legendary** series games, **monopoly, munchkin, galaxy trucker, mice n mystics, or Robinson Crusoe** because I don't feel I have enough player agency. I feel like the game is playing ME","can_gild":true,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1506816115,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"id":"dnqimub","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_73bfvz","parent_id":"t3_73bfvz","permalink":"/r/boardgames/comments/73bfvz/games_your_friends_refuse_to_play/dnqimub/","retrieved_on":1509189652,"score":1,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"boardgames","subreddit_id":"t5_2qmjp"},

{"author":"apollo440","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"body":"Number one. Here's a good way to look at it:\n\nIf you were starting a team and could pick any QB that's ever played, there aren't many you could put above him. Elway's combination of mobility, toughness, a rocket arm and fierce competitiveness make him a compelling choice regardless of who he's compared to. Let's give give it a shot:\n\n**Brady**: Simply one of the greatest to ever play the game, period. He's also had the benefit of playing for THE greatest head coach of all time. That has to be factored into this evaluation. Would Brady have been as great under multiple head coaches? Although we'll never know the answer definitively, history shows that it'd be very difficult to replicate Brady's success under different coaches.\n\nElway however went to five Super Bowls under two different head coaches. Neither of these coaches would even be in the running of GOAT. Also if you compare the QBs head-to-head, Elway is more athletic and mobile than Brady while being just as competitive (Brady's best attribute). Advantage Elway\n\n**Favre**: I never understood why Favre was treated with such reverence when he played. Whenever I think of Favre, I think of back-breaking picks in the playoffs. That alone disqualifies him from consideration. \n\n**Peyton Manning** : Great QB. Gaudy stats. Four Super Bowl appearances with four different head coaches. I wouldn't start him over Elway though. Elway is more mobile and tougher, but his biggest advantage is that he played his best ball under pressure. That's Peyton's biggest weakness. That's a big weakness of most QBs. \n\n**Marino**: Well he was a great QB to be sure. I think his stats were better than Elway overall. But Marino had a downside. I read recently he had less than 100 yards rushing for his ENTIRE career. So even if Marino was a better passer than Elway, I'd consider his lack of mobility to be a significant disadvantage. Also--and this probably isn't all his fault necessarily-- he played for two Super Bowl winning coaches and only had one SB appearance.  Elway took three Reeves-coached squads to the Super Bowl that had no business being there. That's how good he was.  Quick who was Elway's top receiver on those teams? Who was his running back? I can't remember and I actually WATCHED those teams! \n\n**Montana** : Joe Montana was a fucking great QB and arguably is the GOAT. As a fan of both the Broncos and Cowboys (don't ask), I had the pleasure of having my heart ripped out by this muthafucker for over a decade. Accurate, cool under fire with the heart of a champion.  But here's the thing about Montana...dude was fragile by NFL standards. If you put a solid lick on him, he wouldn't get up. That's why he didn't finish his career as a 49er. Toughness is important in this position. Elway was a tough sumamabitch. \n","can_gild":true,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1506816120,"distinguished":null,"edited":1506831219,"gilded":0,"id":"dnqimyw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_73gnf3","parent_id":"t1_dnq4tnp","permalink":"/r/DenverBroncos/comments/73gnf3/for_those_of_you_who_saw_john_elway_play_during/dnqimyw/","retrieved_on":1509189655,"score":15,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DenverBroncos","subreddit_id":"t5_2s51j"},

{"author":"matcht","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"body":"Think he's reading into Moreno's comments a bit too much. Anyone who watches us closely will have noticed that we don't press anywhere near as much anymore, and it's a conscious change.\n\nCould be many reasons for it. One is that we have the CL this season so we can't afford to play such a high energy game every week. We don't have that deep of a squad, and Klopp thus far has only really rotated in the full back areas. City/Spurs have rotated far more effectively than us. Also worth remembering we have the CL playoff round which added games for us, while having to deal with the absence of Clyne, Lallana, Coutinho and dealing with bringing back players from injury (Hendo/Mane/Sturridge).\n\nAnother is that pressing, while effective, when it isn't working, leaves your midfield and defence exposed. Notably when Lallana is missing, we don't have a natural doggish presser aside from Firmino, so Klopp is being pragmatic in the absence of Lallana in order to protect our already vulnerable defence. I can imagine Klopp remembers playing a high pressing game away at Bournemouth or Leicester and then getting caught by simple long balls into the channels.\n\nI remember when Klopp first arrived, the number of hamstring/calf injuries was ridiculous. These injuries have slowed down somewhat, but a less intensive pressing game will have helped.","can_gild":true,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1506816120,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"id":"dnqimzp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_73ib7f","parent_id":"t3_73ib7f","permalink":"/r/soccer/comments/73ib7f/klopps_pressing_problem_lfc_running_less_pressing/dnqimzp/","retrieved_on":1509189655,"score":6,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"soccer","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi58"},

{"author":"JSryder3894","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"body":"I have to agree with a lot of the critiques here.  The pilot showed a lot of promise, but the show just went down hill from there.  The show had so much potential to be an accurate portrayal of the origins of hip hop and how the culture of the 70s in NYC really influenced not only a generation but changed the landscape of the music industry in general.  \n\nBut sadly they just didn't portray it very realistically and it wasn't, like someone else said, raw or real enough.  And don't get me started on the whole rape scene where Leslie Lesgold forces Jackie Moreno to go down on her because he once coerced her into giving him a blowjob and then fired her way back when she interned for him.  Really?  Such BS and so completely unrealistic.  I lived through that era, women got used and sexually exploited all the time and not just in the music industry.  Back then it was the unofficial and deeply repulsive status quo that in order for a woman to get a ahead, pardon the pun, she had to give head and much more. If she didn't play that game she got black listed and her career was over.  \n\nOnce a woman gained stardom then it was different story, but even then the male power players of the day ran the show and their word was law.  Back then no woman would dare pull some revenge crap like Leslie did, because no male power player then would ever allow a woman to have that kind of power.  Sorry ladies but rape revenge like what Leslie did, however empowering and entertaining, was not only not practical but due to the culture of the time would never have happened. So yeah that was the big BS exclamation point on the ending of that show, that and the ridiculous amount of money Netflix spent on it.  The Get Down deserved to get cancelled.  Overall though, with all of Netflix's other hit shows, one miss like the get down shouldn't hurt their overhead much at all.  They are still hitting it out of the park with shows like Luke Cage and Stranger Things, as well as a lot of their other original shows and the ones they currently got in development.  The Get Down will barely end up as a hiccup in what has become Netflix's original show money making machine.  \n","can_gild":true,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1506816122,"distinguished":null,"edited":1506816343,"gilded":0,"id":"dnqin1m","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_6d6lln","parent_id":"t3_6d6lln","permalink":"/r/hiphopheads/comments/6d6lln/the_get_down_canceled_by_netflix/dnqin1m/","retrieved_on":1509189656,"score":2,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"hiphopheads","subreddit_id":"t5_2rh4c"},

{"author":"2airbendes","author_flair_css_class":"g4","author_flair_text":"Pegasus Knight","body":"You're assuming way too much about the average player here when it's a huge player base, there's no way everyone started when the game started. People still complain about no Camus/Xander repeat because they started after that point. There's no way everyone has the same goal of collecting every unit at 4* level 40 when there's literally no point to that either. The only thing the game actually tracks is 5* level 40s. F2P have limited barrack space and limited supplies of feathers, so there's nothing in game even wanting you to do this. I've upgraded literally 7 total units to 5* with the amount of Feathers I've gathered since I started playing and I don't have enough to upgrade someone to 5* right now. And two of those were 4* s I pulled and wanted to build up, like a ton of other users would want to do with their favorite units, which would be a much more important goal for them than raising their Virion to 4* level 40 using the Feathers and stamina they would've otherwise put into a +10 Selena or something. \nEven if somehow there was several thousand like minded individuals who did that, you'd still not be able to follow a lot of guides because they require 3* s, and throwing off stats even IV wise entirely messes up strategies. Some strategies need people like Arthur or Stahl or Serena there at 3* because they can soak hits, but won't kill a specific unit at a choke point. So bringing your 4* Serena/Arthur/Stahl means you mess up the strategy, the Axe you were stalling dies, and the Lance behind it kills Serena/Stahl instead. \n \nBesides the whole \"yeah but what if this or what if that\", the entire point is \"what if people don't have this\", your argument here is \"well, they should\", my point is \"yeah, but they don't\". How does your argument actually fix the situation those people are in who see that video about the easy 4* Oboro level 40 wall strategy, and then realize they'd have to spend like 150 stamina and 2000 Feathers just for this one orb they're wanting to earn?

{"author":"Hitlers_Art_Teacher","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"body":"**POTD Record:** 7-0-1 (W-P-L)\n\nStreak: 6W\n\nPick record: 23-2-16\n\nBonus Picks record: 17-1-23\n***\n\n*Had a decent day yesterday. The POTD pick - Coventry won, and I got 4/6 picks as winners with one other as a push*\n\n**POTD:**\n\n**Double: Torino to Win &amp; Inter Milan to Win - 1.60 (L - 2-2 &amp; 1-2. Torino concede 2 goals in the last 6 minutes to lose the bet, unbelievable!)**\n\nNow I like to stick to singles, especially for POTD but after researching through all the games I like today there's nothing that puts me over the edge for certainly other than these picks. I was thinking of doing the Lazio game O2.5 goals as I can see both teams scoring there or even Lazio scoring 3 just themselves but I'm not 100% confident and a 2-0 win in that game wouldn't surprise me. \n\nSo, into detail about Torino's game. They host Verona today who I've talked about in previous picks about how utterly terrible they are and if reports are to be believed their manager is close to the sack. Verona have looked hopeless through 6 games with a record of 0-2-4, only scoring 1 (from a penalty) and conceding 14. \n\nTorino have been decent so far this season. They find themselves 7th with a record of 3-2-1, goals 10:9. Attackers Belotti and Ljajic have been in good form with 3 goals each and are very likely to score today, Belotti has scored in the two home games Torino have played so far. With Verona's horrible scoring record I doubt they'll score today but if they do it'll only be 1 and Torino have more than enough quality to get 2+. Defensive mid Baselli will be missing after being sent off last week, Obi &amp; Barreca will also miss out for the hosts but they'll be able to cope without them. \n\nIn the other game, Inter play away to Benevento who are equally as bad as Verona and sit in last place, also just scoring the 1 goal and have conceded 16 goals already after being smashed by Napoli 6-0 and Roma 4-0. It won't get any easier for them here against Inter who have won 5 and drawn once in their games and have the best defensive record in the league. \n\nInter were lucky to win last week against Genoa, but they continued their record of scoring in every game. That comes mostly thanks to Icardi who is up to 6 goals already and will like his chances of bagging a couple today, I might put a little on him to even get a hat trick. As far as injuries go Inter are only missing Cancelo who hasn't played in a month anyway. It could be a rout here after some of Benevento's performances but Inter don't tend to be a big scoring team so I'm expecting 2-0/3-0 here. \n\n***\n*Quite a lot of games I like today, so I'll try to whittle them down to just the better looking ones for picks*\n\n**Picks:**\n\n\u2022 **Arsenal v Brighton - Arsenal Clean Sheet YES - 1.80 (W - 2-0)**\n\nOriginally this pick was going to be Arsenal to Win to Nil but the odds so similar for just a clean sheet that it seems much more worth it in case Arsenal can't score somehow. \n\nArsenal have kept their last 6/8 home matches as clean sheets. They've shown how impressive at home they are winning all their games so far conceding all their only hole goals let in in that early 4-3 thriller against Leicester. \n\nBrighton have struggled for goals this season, they're scored 5 in 6 (3 goals coming against West Brom) and have only scored 1 away from home so far. To get a better look at how I expect this game to play out I looked at how they faired against their only big team they faced yet Man City and the stats show a 79/21% possession to Man City, showing that Brighton are likely to sit back and try to grind out a draw today against Arsenal. \n\n\u2022 **Everton v Burnley - Burnley or Draw - 2.25 (W - 0-1)**\n\nI fucked up here, looking at the odds Burnley +1.0AH @1.65 are a much better pick than this so if you're reading this pick late I would take that, I still feel Burnley can draw here and I won't change my pick after the fact so here are the stats. \n\nBurnley have performed well this season with a record of 2-3-1, goals 6:5. Away from home Burnley have really turned it on after a terrible record last season, this season they won at Chelsea 2-1, as well as getting 1-1 draws at Spurs &amp; Liverpool. If Burnley do lose it tends to be only by a goal, although last season Everton were one of the only teams able to beat by that margin winning 3-1 but this is a different Everton this year. \n\nEverton have struggled for goals. They've scored 4 in 6, 2 of them coming last game where they were fortunate to get away with a win. Koeman is under pressure at the moment and will want to continue Everton's winning streak. If Burnley are able to get the first goal then the Goodison Park crowd will be booing and they will get on their players backs, that pressure might be too much. \n\n\u2022 **Atalanta v Juventus -- BTTS - 1.95 (W - 2-2)**\n\nThe head to head record here has BTTS in the last 4/6. Atalanta have had 5/6 BTTS too. Both teams have scored in all of their games so far (except for when Juve played Barca). I think both teams will fancy their chances and have inform players on either side in Gomez and Dybala. I like the O2.5 goals here too, it was 2-2 in this game last season and it could be agin today. \n\n\u2022 **Torino v Verona -- Torino Clean Sheet YES - 2.20 (L - 2-2)**\n\nExplained in POTD. \n\n\u2022 **Benevento v Inter Milan -- Inter -2.0 Asian Handicap - 2.20 (L - 1-2)**\n\nExplained in POTD. \n\n\u2022 **Benevento v Inter Milan -- Inter to Win to Nil - 1.95 (L - 0-2)**\n\nExplained in POTD. \n\n\u2022 **Hertha Berlin v Bayern Munich -- Hertha Berlin to Score 1+ goals - 1.90 (W - 2-2)**\n\nI've explained this pick in a comment below. \n\n\u2022 **Koln v RB Leipzig -- Leipzig to Win - 2.00 (W - 1-2)**\n\n\u2022 **Nice v Marseille -- Nice Draw No Bet - 1.92 (L - 2-4. Nice we're 2-0 up! That would have paid out with some bookies Ina straight win, how annoying)**\n\n\u2022 **Maritimo v Benfica -- Maritimo +1.0 Asian Handicap - 2.06 (W - 1-1)**\n\n*Lastly, I would not advise putting these all into an acca. As much as I'd like them all to win, it's always unlikely with this many picks so if you do feel you have to combine them in some way please choose a double of your favs or even a treble. Anything more and you're asking for trouble.*\n\n**Bonus Picks: (Odds of Evens or greater)**\n\n\u2022 Everton v Burnley -- Draw - 3.80 (L)\n\n\u2022 Newcastle v Liverpool -- BTTS &amp; O2.5 goals - 2.00 (L)\n\n\u2022 Benevento v Inter Milan -- Inter -3.0 Asian Handicap - 4.40 (L)\n\n\u2022 Hertha Berlin or Draw - 3.50 (W)\n\n\u2022 Hertha Berlin to Win - 11.00 (small units) [L]\n\n\u2022 Heerenveen or Draw - 2.20 (L)\n\n\u2022 Maritimo Draw No Bet - 5.50 (P)\n\n*Apologies for any spelling &amp; grammar errors, I am writing this all on my phone*","can_gild":true,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1506816130,"distinguished":null,"edited":1506946194,"gilded":0,"id":"dnqin8t","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_738phh","parent_id":"t3_738phh","permalink":"/r/SoccerBetting/comments/738phh/daily_picks_thread_sunday_1102017/dnqin8t/","retrieved_on":1509189658,"score":8,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SoccerBetting","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4wz"},
